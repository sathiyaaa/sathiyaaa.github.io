              <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Sathiya Prakash</strong>.  Inquisitive is the closest word I can relate myself to. I find myself wondering about the 'whys' and the 'whats' often. That's when I found that my passion lies in developing and managing technological products that has the potential to solve problems at scale. I am a software developer by profession.</p>

              <p> I've been part of a funded early stage fintech start-up, a Big-4 consulting firm & a funded ed-tech growth stage startup.</p>
              <p>I love analysing problems, asking questions and breaking it up into action items. Apart from designing and developing, I read non-fiction and design books , medidate and network with like-minds.</p>


              <p>
                I am always in for a conversation about <b>Product, UI/UX design, Data and Football.</b>

                <div class="col-sm-8">I have been enthralled by deep learning ever since I came across it. My friend and I decided to deep-dive on it and hence worked on building
                  a deep learning classifier for accurate detection of the Novel Corona Virus by using convolutional neural networks. The research manuscript is recently published
                  by the <b>Bioscience Biotechnology Research Communications.</b>  <a class= "research-link" href="https://bbrc.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galley-Proof-001.pdf" title="Research Manuscript">Read it here</a>  :)
